## Milestone 1 (29th March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

Welcome to **Vinemap**—your digital sommelier. We aim to create an interactive website to bring to life the rich data of over 100,000 wines from across the globe.

At the heart of Vinemap lies an interactive map, a feature that sets it apart from existing platforms, and serves as the gateway to a richer understanding and appreciation of global wine culture. Did you know that there are over 10,000 grape varieties throughout the world? Each region offers its own incredible stories, grape varieties, and unique wine-making traditions that contribute to the immense diversity of wine.

But Vinemap will be more than just a map; a toolkit for any wine lovers that will match you to your specific tastes, budget, and a particular fondness for regional wines.

Embark on this adventure with us to appreciate the diversity of wines from all over the world.

Join us on this expedition to explore and celebrate the diversity of wines from across the planet.





### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
