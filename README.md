## Milestone 1 (29th March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

Welcome to **Vinemap**—your digital sommelier. We aim to create an interactive website to bring to life the rich data of over 100,000 wines from across the globe.

At the heart of Vinemap lies an interactive map, a feature that sets it apart from existing platforms, and serves as the gateway to a richer understanding and appreciation of global wine culture. Did you know that there are over 10,000 grape varieties throughout the world? Each region offers its own incredible stories, grape varieties, and unique wine-making traditions that contribute to the immense diversity of wine.

But Vinemap will be more than just a map; a toolkit for any wine lovers that will match you to your specific tastes, budget, and a particular fondness for regional wines.

Embark on this adventure with us to appreciate the diversity of wines from all over the world.

Join us on this expedition to explore and celebrate the diversity of wines from across the planet.





### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

Drawing inspiration from "The World Atlas of Wine" by Hugh Johnson and Jancis Robinson, our project seeks to enhance the way wine enthusiasts explore the world of viticulture and oenology via an innovative digital and interactive map.  This map aims to encapsulate the rich and detailed information found within the book, while providing the added advantage of interactive elements that allow users to easily access the specificities of each region's wine production. Our motivation to pursue this digital transformation stems from the limitations of static print media, which, while informative, cannot offer the dynamic engagement a digital platform can.

During our search for inspiration among previous projects, we came across one particularly interesting project titled "Wine 101."  While this offered valuable insights into the basics of wine tasting, our interests lied in mapping the terroir and climate that define each wine region, thereby presenting a more rounded perspective of the global wine landscape. The originality of our approach lies not just in the map’s interactivity but in its educational potential to transform casual wine appreciation into a well-informed hobby. Through this project, we present a comprehensive global overview of wine production, while simultaneously offering detailed insights into each individual wine, ensuring a balanced exploration at both large and small scales.
